# Author contributions

This is the list of PyPhi's main contributors, in alphabetical order.

This does not necessarily list everyone who has contributed code, nor does it
list everyone who has improved this software in other ways: for example, by
giving valuable feedback, suggesting ideas for new features, or participating
in stimulating discussions.

We are grateful to everyone who has helped us throughout PyPhi's development,
and to the users who make it worth developing.

Specific contributions are mentioned here, but not exhaustively; for a more
detailed list of code contributions, see the git revision history.
